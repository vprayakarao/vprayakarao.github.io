### Northern Lights

Chasing the Northern Lights under the veil of darkness was like a magical dream dancing across the sky. Fairbanks is a world-famous aurora viewing location as its located directly under the “Auroral Oval” where northern lights activity is concentrated. We chased the Northern Lights from 10pm to 3am for three nights where the activity was very high which gave us a greater chance of seeing the aurora. Clear nights with dark skies make the Aurora Viewing Experience even richer. We took an Aurora viewing tour at Chena Hot Springs and also a cozy lodge aurora viewing space.

### Dog Sledding

Dog-mushing experience outside of Fairbanks is a must do activity in Fairbanks. Taking a trail ride in North Pole involving a dog sled pulled by a team of Alaskan Huskies was the most amazing experience of this trip
