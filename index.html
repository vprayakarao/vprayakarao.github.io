<h3>1.Reign Of Gunters </h3>
      <p>Gunter loves to smash bottles! For this task, the robot will be placed in a maze. There will be several objects (bottles) placed along the walls in the maze.The robot must navigate through the maze, find the locations of the objects and hit them with the gripper so they would fall.

		<h3>2. Design of an Autonomous Micro-Air Vehicle</h3>
      <p>I worked on the development of a 500 gram Vision-based Autonomous Quadrotor Vehicle Capable of Indoor Navigation.I have extensively worked with the Pixhawk flight controller of the air vehicle and interfaced it with Odroid (Onboard flight computer) using ROS.
         I have also worked on developing the ROS - obstacle detection module using Teraranger (Range Finder) and servo.

			<h3>3. Consensus in Networked Multi-Agent Systems</h3>
			<p>During the first phase of our work, we have worked on theoretical framework for the
			analysis of consensus algorithms. We have performed simulations focusing on a specific
			application of achieving consensus in complex networks. We observed the convergence
			rates for networks with changes in topology and time-delays. We also implemented various
			forms of consensus algorithms in MATLAB and visualised the networks generated
			using Cytoscape.During the second phase,we have worked in the Robotics lab to carry out
			experimental studies to verify the simulation results and implement different formations
			on Pioneer3 series mobile robots .</p>
